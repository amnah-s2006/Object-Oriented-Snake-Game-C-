This project is a complete implementation of the classic Snake game built in C++ using a fully object-oriented design. The codebase is structured around clear class responsibilities defined through a UML-style design, making the project modular, readable, and easy to extend.

Custom data structures were developed to manage game objects and positions efficiently. The project emphasizes correct dynamic memory management, including explicit handling of copying and destruction through the Rule of Five/Six to prevent memory leaks and ensure safe object behavior.

Core gameplay mechanics include finite state machine (FSM)-based player movement, collision detection, screen wraparound logic, and centralized game-state control for scoring and overall game flow. The design prioritizes clean separation between game mechanics, data handling, and control logic, reflecting real-world software engineering practices.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, memory-safe design, and structured problem-solving in a systems-level C++ application.
